Dockerized backup system that pulls continuous surveillance video from a UniFi Protect device (CloudKey, UCG, UDM, UNVR, etc.), remuxes `.ubv` files to `.mp4`, renames them with camera names, and archives them to a NAS.

> **Note:** Recordings can only be backed up after the Protect device finishes writing them, so there is an inherent delay (typically one recording segment, ~1 GB per file). This is **not** real-time replication - it is near-real-time archival. For the best coverage, pair this tool with UniFi Protect's built-in **Continuous Archiving** (UI Labs) feature, which handles detection event clips. As far as we know, this is the only open-source tool that backs up continuous recording video.

## How it works

```
NAS (Docker)                        Protect Device (CloudKey, UCG, UDM, UNVR, etc.)
┌────────────────────────┐          ┌─────────────────────────┐
│  cron → backup.sh      │── SSH -> │  PostgreSQL :5433       │
│                        │          │  .ubv video files       │
│  1. Query DB for files │          └─────────────────────────┘
│  2. SCP .ubv to staging│
│  3. Remux → .mp4       │
│  4. Rename with camera │
│     name + timestamps  │
│  5. Archive to         │
│     /CamName/date/     │
└────────────────────────┘
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose on the NAS (x86_64 or ARM64)
- Network connectivity from the NAS to the Protect device
- SSH enabled on the Protect device (the installer can set up key auth for you)
- A UniFi Protect device with active recordings

### Setting up SSH access

1. **Enable SSH on your Protect device**: In your UniFi Console, go to **Settings -> Control Plane -> Console -> SSH** and enable it. Note the password you set here. The default SSH username is root for Console devices.

2. **Run the installer** - it will detect that SSH key auth isn't set up and offer to configure it automatically. It generates a key if needed and copies it to your Protect device using `ssh-copy-id`. You just need to enter the SSH password once.

   If you prefer to set up SSH manually:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519                  # generate a key (if you don't have one)
   ssh-copy-id root@<protect-host>        # copy it to the Protect device
   ssh root@<protect-host>                # verify it works (no password prompt)
   ```

The container mounts your key from `SSH_KEY_PATH` (defaults to `~/.ssh`) and uses it automatically.

## Quick start

**Option 1** - Standalone install (no git required):
```bash
mkdir -p /opt/unvr-nas-backup && cd /opt/unvr-nas-backup
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ozark-Connect/unvr-nas-backup/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

**Option 2** - Clone the repo (includes helper scripts for status, updates, etc.):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ozark-Connect/unvr-nas-backup.git /opt/unvr-nas-backup
cd /opt/unvr-nas-backup
./install.sh
```

The installer prompts for your Protect device host, archive path, and other settings. It downloads `compose.yml` if needed, pulls the pre-built image from GHCR, and starts the container.

**Manual setup** (no installer):
```bash
mkdir -p /opt/unvr-nas-backup && cd /opt/unvr-nas-backup
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ozark-Connect/unvr-nas-backup/main/compose.yml
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ozark-Connect/unvr-nas-backup/main/.env.example
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env - set PROTECT_HOST and ARCHIVE_PATH at minimum
docker compose up -d
```

## Helper scripts

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `./install.sh` | First-time setup - creates `.env`, tests SSH, pulls image and starts the container |
| `./scripts/status.sh` | Shows backup health: last run, archive stats, disk usage, container/cron status |
| `./scripts/run-now.sh` | Triggers an immediate backup without waiting for cron |
| `./scripts/update.sh` | Pulls latest code and image, and restarts the container |

## Updating

If you cloned the repo:
```bash
cd /opt/unvr-nas-backup
./scripts/update.sh
```

Standalone install:
```bash
cd /opt/unvr-nas-backup
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Your `.env` and archive are preserved in both cases.

## Stopping

```bash
cd /opt/unvr-nas-backup
docker compose down
```

This stops the container. Your archive and `.env` are not affected. Run `docker compose up -d` to start it again.

## Uninstalling

```bash
cd /opt/unvr-nas-backup
docker compose down -v              # stop container and remove staging volume
docker rmi ghcr.io/ozark-connect/unvr-nas-backup:latest   # remove the image
cd / && rm -rf /opt/unvr-nas-backup # remove install directory
```

Your archive directory is **not** deleted automatically. Remove it manually if you no longer need the recordings.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PROTECT_HOST` | *(required)* | Hostname or IP of your Protect device |
| `PROTECT_SSH_USER` | `root` | SSH user (`root` on most devices, may differ on standalone UNVRs) |
| `PROTECT_VIDEO_PATH` | `/srv/unifi-protect/video` | Fallback video path if the DB-reported folder is not accessible |
| `PROTECT_DB_PORT` | `5433` | PostgreSQL port |
| `PROTECT_DB_NAME` | `unifi-protect` | PostgreSQL database name |
| `BACKUP_HOURS` | `1` | How many hours back to look for recordings. Set this to at least 2x your cron interval so recordings that finish between runs are not missed. |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | `5` | Number of files to SCP before pausing |
| `BATCH_DELAY` | `30` | Seconds to pause between SCP batches |
| `ARCHIVE_PATH` | *(required)* | Host path for the archive volume mount |
| `SSH_KEY_PATH` | `~/.ssh` | Host path to SSH keys (mounted read-only) |
| `CRON_SCHEDULE` | `*/15 * * * *` | Cron expression for backup frequency (do not quote this value) |
| `RUN_ON_START` | `true` | Run a backup immediately on container start |
| `TZ` | `UTC` | Timezone for log messages. Archive filenames always use UTC regardless of this setting. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

> **Disk usage**: Continuous recording generates roughly 10-20 GB per camera per day depending on resolution and scene activity. Plan your archive storage accordingly.

## Compatibility

Tested and confirmed working on:

| Device | Status |
|---|---|
| UniFi CloudKey Gen2+ | Tested |
| UniFi Cloud Gateway (UCG-Fiber, UCG-Ultra, UCG-Max, etc.) | Tested |
| UniFi Dream Machine (UDM, UDM-Pro, UDM-SE, etc.) | Likely compatible - testers welcome |
| UniFi Dream Router (UDR, etc.) | Likely compatible - testers welcome |
| UniFi NVR (UNVR, UNVR-Pro, etc.) | Likely compatible - testers welcome |

Should work on any device running UniFi Protect with SSH access, PostgreSQL on port 5433, and `.ubv` video files at `/srv/unifi-protect/video`. If you've tested on a device not listed here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Ozark-Connect/unvr-nas-backup/issues) to let us know.

## Archive structure

Files are stored canonically by camera, with date-based symlinks for browsing by date:

```
/archive/
├── by-camera/                          # Canonical storage
│   ├── Front-Door/
│   │   ├── 2026-02-19/
│   │   │   ├── Front-Door_2026-02-19_08-00-00_to_08-05-00.mp4
│   │   │   └── Front-Door_2026-02-19_08-05-00_to_08-10-00.mp4
│   │   └── 2026-02-20/
│   │       └── ...
│   └── Backyard/
│       └── ...
└── by-date/                            # Symlinks
    ├── 2026-02-19/
    │   ├── Front-Door → ../../by-camera/Front-Door/2026-02-19
    │   └── Backyard   → ../../by-camera/Backyard/2026-02-19
    └── 2026-02-20/
        └── ...
```

> **Note:** The `by-date` directory uses symlinks, which may not be visible when browsing via SMB/Windows shares. The `by-camera` directory always works directly.

## Troubleshooting

- **SSH fails**: Ensure your SSH key is in `SSH_KEY_PATH` and is authorized on the Protect device. The container copies keys to fix permissions automatically.
- **No recordings found**: Increase `BACKUP_HOURS` or check that the device has active recordings. Only `type=rotating` and `active=false` files are selected.
- **Remux fails**: Verify the `.ubv` file is complete (not still being recorded). The query filters `active=false` to prevent this.
- **Container shows unhealthy**: This is normal until the first successful backup completes. With `RUN_ON_START=true` (the default), this resolves within a few minutes of starting.
- **Disk space**: The backup script logs two levels of disk space warnings that you can use to set up alerts (e.g., Docker log monitoring, webhook, etc.):
  - `[backup] ... WARN: Archive volume has less than 100 GB free` - time to plan cleanup
  - `[backup] ... CRITICAL: Archive volume has less than 10 GB free` - backups may start failing

  There is no automatic pruning yet (coming soon). You are responsible for managing retention (e.g., deleting old date folders, NAS-level quotas, or a cron job). Staging is cleaned after each run.
- **Permissions**: The installer needs Docker access and write permissions to the archive path - on most NAS systems you're already root. The container runs as root internally for cron, SSH key handling, and volume writes. It does not expose any ports or accept inbound connections.
