# unvr-nas-backup

Dockerized backup system that pulls continuous surveillance video from a UniFi Protect device (CloudKey, UCG, UDM, UNVR, etc.), remuxes `.ubv` files to `.mp4`, renames them with camera names, and archives them to a NAS.

> **Note:** Recordings can only be backed up after the Protect device finishes writing them, so there is an inherent delay (typically one recording segment, ~1 GB per file). This is **not** real-time replication — it is near-real-time archival. For the best coverage, pair this tool with UniFi Protect's built-in **Continuous Archiving** (UI Labs) feature, which handles detection event clips. As far as we know, this is the only open-source tool that backs up continuous recording video.

## How it works

```
NAS (Docker)                        Protect Device (CloudKey, UCG, UDM, UNVR, etc.)
┌────────────────────────┐          ┌─────────────────────────┐
│  cron → backup.sh      │── SSH -> │  PostgreSQL :5433       │
│                        │          │  .ubv video files       │
│  1. Query DB for files │          └─────────────────────────┘
│  2. SCP .ubv to staging│
│  3. Remux → .mp4       │
│  4. Rename with camera │
│     name + timestamps  │
│  5. Archive to         │
│     /CamName/date/     │
└────────────────────────┘
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose on the NAS (x86_64 or ARM64)
- SSH key-based access from the NAS to the Protect device (`ssh root@<host>` must work without a password)
- UniFi Protect running with PostgreSQL on port 5433

## Quick start

```bash
# Clone to NAS
git clone https://github.com/Ozark-Connect/unvr-nas-backup.git /opt/unvr-nas-backup
cd /opt/unvr-nas-backup

# Interactive install — prompts for host and archive path, pulls image and starts
./install.sh

# Or manually:
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set PROTECT_HOST and ARCHIVE_PATH at minimum
docker compose up -d
```

The pre-built image is pulled automatically from `ghcr.io/ozark-connect/unvr-nas-backup:latest`. To build locally instead, run `docker compose build`.

## Helper scripts

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `./install.sh` | First-time setup — creates `.env`, tests SSH, pulls image and starts the container |
| `./scripts/status.sh` | Shows backup health: last run, archive stats, disk usage, container/cron status |
| `./scripts/run-now.sh` | Triggers an immediate backup without waiting for cron |
| `./scripts/update.sh` | Pulls latest code and image, and restarts the container |

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PROTECT_HOST` | *(required)* | Hostname or IP of your Protect device |
| `PROTECT_SSH_USER` | `root` | SSH user (`root` on most devices, may differ on standalone UNVRs) |
| `PROTECT_VIDEO_PATH` | `/srv/unifi-protect/video` | Video file path on the device (standard on all known devices) |
| `PROTECT_DB_PORT` | `5433` | PostgreSQL port |
| `PROTECT_DB_NAME` | `unifi-protect` | PostgreSQL database name |
| `BACKUP_HOURS` | `1` | How many hours back to look for recordings. Set this to at least 2x your cron interval so recordings that finish between runs are not missed. |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | `5` | Number of files to SCP before pausing |
| `BATCH_DELAY` | `30` | Seconds to pause between SCP batches |
| `ARCHIVE_PATH` | *(required)* | Host path for the archive volume mount |
| `SSH_KEY_PATH` | `~/.ssh` | Host path to SSH keys (mounted read-only) |
| `CRON_SCHEDULE` | `*/15 * * * *` | Cron expression for backup frequency (do not quote this value) |
| `RUN_ON_START` | `true` | Run a backup immediately on container start |
| `TZ` | `UTC` | Timezone for log messages. Archive filenames always use UTC regardless of this setting. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

> **Disk usage**: Continuous recording generates roughly 10–20 GB per camera per day depending on resolution and scene activity. Plan your archive storage accordingly.

## Compatibility

Tested and confirmed working on:

| Device | Status |
|---|---|
| UniFi CloudKey Gen2+ | Tested |
| UniFi Cloud Gateway (UCG-Fiber, UCG-Ultra, UCG-Max, etc.) | Tested |
| UniFi Dream Machine (UDM, UDM-Pro, UDM-SE, etc.) | Likely compatible — testers welcome |
| UniFi Dream Router (UDR, etc.) | Likely compatible — testers welcome |
| UniFi NVR (UNVR, UNVR-Pro, etc.) | Likely compatible — testers welcome |

Should work on any device running UniFi Protect with SSH access, PostgreSQL on port 5433, and `.ubv` video files at `/srv/unifi-protect/video`. If you've tested on a device not listed here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Ozark-Connect/unvr-nas-backup/issues) to let us know.

## Archive structure

Files are stored canonically by camera, with date-based symlinks for browsing by date:

```
/archive/
├── by-camera/                          # Canonical storage
│   ├── Front-Door/
│   │   ├── 2026-02-19/
│   │   │   ├── Front-Door_2026-02-19_08-00-00_to_08-05-00.mp4
│   │   │   └── Front-Door_2026-02-19_08-05-00_to_08-10-00.mp4
│   │   └── 2026-02-20/
│   │       └── ...
│   └── Backyard/
│       └── ...
└── by-date/                            # Symlinks
    ├── 2026-02-19/
    │   ├── Front-Door → ../../by-camera/Front-Door/2026-02-19
    │   └── Backyard   → ../../by-camera/Backyard/2026-02-19
    └── 2026-02-20/
        └── ...
```

> **Note:** The `by-date` directory uses symlinks, which may not be visible when browsing via SMB/Windows shares. The `by-camera` directory always works directly.

## Troubleshooting

- **SSH fails**: Ensure your SSH key is in `SSH_KEY_PATH` and is authorized on the Protect device. The container copies keys to fix permissions automatically.
- **No recordings found**: Increase `BACKUP_HOURS` or check that the device has active recordings. Only `type=rotating` and `active=false` files are selected.
- **Remux fails**: Verify the `.ubv` file is complete (not still being recorded). The query filters `active=false` to prevent this.
- **Disk space**: Monitor `/staging` (named volume) and `/archive`. Staging is cleaned after each run. The backup script warns when archive space drops below 1 GB.
